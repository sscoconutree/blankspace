<h3>UNC4990 obfuscation technique to hide payloads on a "blank" text file</h3>

I recently saw an article from Mandiant that covered this technique used by UNC4990 on which it sparked my interest to develop a script that encodes and decodes based from this technique. Can be useful for red team engagements or if you encountered a similar text file, you can use the decoding script to see the deobfuscated version.
